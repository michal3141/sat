Formulas for numbers in range [2**n, 2**(n+1)-1] (formulas for n-bit numbers) has:
- The same number of variables
- The same number of clauses
- The same number of literals
- The same number of negated and non-negated literals in total
- Different number of literal collisions (but this vary similar to number of 0's in binary representation) *


XOR-3SAT generated from the problem seems to be unsatisfiable for all integers - tested up to 1000's **

* By literal collision we mean an occurrence of x and ~x in different clauses. Each such pair is called literal collision
** XOR-3SAT is generated by replacing or's with xor's in all clauses
